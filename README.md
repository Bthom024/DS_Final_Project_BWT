# DS_Final_Project_BWT
This repository contains all necessary files, code, and documents related to the capstone project for DS-450-01.
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for breast cancer recurrence, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes. Breast cancer recurrence, whether local or metastatic, remains a significant challenge in cancer care, and accurate prediction of recurrence risks is crucial for personalized treatment planning and long-term monitoring. The project will utilize a comprehensive dataset, which includes clinical and demographic features like tumor size, lymph node status, and age.
